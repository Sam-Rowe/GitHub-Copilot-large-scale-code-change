# Book Planning Framework: GitHub Copilot for Large Scale Code Change

## Purpose

To provide a practical, experience-driven guide for using GitHub Copilot to drive
large scale code changes, based on real-world customer engagements and interviews.

## Content Development Plan

### 1. Research & Interviews

- Identify and reach out to practitioners with experience in large scale code change.
- Conduct interviews and gather stories from customer engagements.
- Document key challenges, solutions, and lessons learned.

### 2. Content Structure

- Use the outline in README.md as the chapter framework.
- For each chapter, collect:
  - Real-world examples

  - Practical tips and checklists
  - References to documentation and tools

### 3. Writing Process

- Draft chapters iteratively, starting with high-level summaries, then expanding
  with details and stories.
- Review and revise content with input from interviewees and the community.
- Ensure each section includes actionable advice and lessons learned.

### 4. Community Involvement

- Invite feedback and contributions via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- Host discussions or Q&A sessions with practitioners.
- Regularly update the book with new insights and case studies.

### 5. Publication & Maintenance

- Publish the book as an open source project on GitHub.
- Maintain a changelog and roadmap for future updates.
- Encourage ongoing contributions and sharing of new experiences.
