# Introduction

## Purpose of the book

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can assist developers in making large scale code changes more efficiently. This book aims to provide practical guidance and inspired by real-world experience of how to leverage Copilot for such tasks. Where possible I have replicated real world customer experience into open source projects to verify and share results and the rest of the book is inspired (in a privacy concious way) the way I have seen GitHub Copilot used. 

## Who this book is for

This book is for anyone involved in large scale code changes. This includes developers, team leads, architects, heads of engineering, and anyone else who is interested in using GitHub Copilot to make a large change to a codebase. 

What do I mean by large scale code change? I think some examples are in order because i couldn't find a better way to define the large gamuat of ideas I want to cover in this book. 
Migrating a Java application to Python is a large scale code change. 
Rewriting a monolith to a microservices architecture is a large scale code change.
Refactoring a large codebase that uses an outdated framework to a modern framework is a large scale code change
Refactoring from Mocha testing to Jest testing is a large scale code change.
Increasing code coverage of a codebase is a large scale code change.
