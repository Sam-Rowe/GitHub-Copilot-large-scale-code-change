# Introduction

## Purpose of the book

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can assist developers in making large scale code changes more efficiently. This book aims to provide practical guidance and inspired by real-world experience of how to leverage Copilot for such tasks. Where possible I have replicated real world customer experience into open source projects to verify and share results and the rest of the book is inspired (in a privacy concious way) the way I have seen GitHub Copilot used.
