# The Case for Large Scale Code Change

> **Note for Readers:** If you're a developer, you might be tempted to skip this chapter and jump straight to the technical implementation details. However, if you're a technical leader, engineering manager, or business stakeholder, this chapter is essential reading. It provides the business case and strategic context that will help you secure buy-in, allocate resources effectively, and measure the success of large-scale code transformation initiatives.

Large-scale code changes represent one of the most significant challenges and opportunities in modern software development. This chapter examines why these transformations are not merely beneficial but essential for organisational survival, the inherent risks and costs involved, and how AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot are fundamentally changing the economics of code modernisation.

## Why large scale changes are needed

Large scale code changes are often necessary to keep up with the evolving landscape of software development. As technologies advance, teams may find themselves working with outdated frameworks, languages, or architectures that hinder their ability to deliver new features or maintain existing systems effectively. This can lead to increased technical debt, reduced developer productivity, and a lack of alignment with modern best practices. Further to this, maintenance can be a significant burden as heritage applications become harder to find developers to work on them and the surrounding ecosystem of tools and libraries becomes less supported.

When this happens businesses may struggle to innovate and stay competitive in their respective markets. The inability to adapt to new technologies or methodologies can result in missed opportunities, decreased customer satisfaction, and ultimately, a decline in revenue. Therefore, large scale code changes are not just beneficial but essential for organisations looking to thrive in today's fast-paced digital landscape.

Using GitHub Copilot to assist in these changes at scale we can accelerate the process, lower the cost to the business to supercharge the change at scale and enable teams to focus on new features and innovation rather than being bogged down by legacy code maintenance.

## Common challenges and risks

Historically large scale code changes have been fraught with challenges and risks. Teams often face difficulties in understanding the existing codebase, which can be complex and poorly documented. This lack of clarity can lead to mistakes, regressions, and unintended consequences during the refactoring or migration process. Additionally, large scale changes can disrupt ongoing development efforts, causing delays and frustration among team members.

The costs just in terms of developer time and materials to implement large scale changes can be significant. Teams may need to invest considerable effort in planning, testing, and validating their changes, which can divert resources away from other important initiatives.

Often the best developers are not available to work on the large scale changes updating heritage codebases, as they focus on new features and innovation in other areas of the business.

As new paradigms in computing emerge, such as microservices, serverless architectures, or containerization, teams may struggle to adapt their existing codebases to these new paradigms. This can lead to a mismatch between the code and the desired architecture, resulting in increased complexity and maintenance challenges. This is most prevalent in Mainframe applications that may have been written decades ago to work on highly resilient hardware that is no longer available or supported.

## Transformation patterns and GitHub Copilot impact

Through my experience working with organisations on large-scale code transformations, I've observed consistent patterns where GitHub Copilot significantly accelerates the change process and reduces business costs. Whilst I cannot share specific customer details, I can outline these patterns and explain how AI-assisted development transforms the economics of large-scale code change.

### Pattern 1: Legacy database modernisation

**The challenge:** Organisations often need to migrate from legacy database systems (such as mainframe COBOL databases) to modern data layers whilst maintaining business continuity and data integrity.

**How GitHub Copilot transforms this work:**

- **Code generation acceleration:** Copilot can rapidly generate data access layer code, reducing the time to write database connection logic, SQL queries, and data transformation utilities
- **Pattern recognition:** When migrating similar database access patterns, Copilot mimics initial examples and can suggest consistent implementations across the codebase
- **Error reduction:** AI assistance helps generate more robust error handling and data validation code, reducing the risk of data corruption during migration
- **Testing support:** Copilot can suggest comprehensive test cases for data integrity validation, ensuring migration accuracy

**Business impact:** Organisations typically see dramatic reductions in developer time required for database access code conversion, enabling faster migration timelines and reduced project costs.

### Pattern 2: Middleware modernisation

**The challenge:** Moving from proprietary middleware solutions to open-source alternatives requires understanding both the legacy and target code architecture, often with limited documentation.

**How GitHub Copilot transforms this work:**

- **Configuration generation:** AI assistance helps generate configuration files and connection logic for new middleware systems
- **Integration patterns:** Copilot can suggest proven integration patterns and error handling approaches for the target middleware
- **Documentation creation:** AI can help generate documentation for the new middleware implementations, improving future maintainability

**Business impact:** Teams report significant improvements in service migration velocity, with developers able to convert services more quickly and with higher confidence in the resulting code quality.

### Pattern 3: Test coverage transformation

**The challenge:** Adding comprehensive test coverage to legacy codebases is time-consuming and requires deep understanding of existing business logic.

**How GitHub Copilot transforms this work:**

- **Test generation:** Copilot can analyse existing code and suggest comprehensive test cases, including edge cases that developers might miss
- **Mock creation:** AI assistance helps generate mock objects and test data, reducing the setup time for complex tests
- **Assertion suggestions:** Copilot can suggest appropriate assertions based on the code being tested, improving test quality
- **Refactoring support:** When code needs modification for better testability, Copilot can suggest refactoring approaches that maintain functionality whilst improving test coverage

**Business impact:** Projects that previously required months to achieve meaningful test coverage can now reach their targets in significantly shorter timeframes, reducing project delivery times and enabling faster feature development.

### Pattern 4: Framework modernisation

**The challenge:** Migrating applications from outdated UI frameworks to modern alternatives (such as custom UI components to SwiftUI, or legacy web frameworks to modern React/Vue) requires significant refactoring whilst maintaining user experience.

**How GitHub Copilot transforms this work:**

- **Component translation:** Copilot can suggest modern framework equivalents for legacy UI components, reducing research time
- **Pattern consistency:** AI assistance helps maintain design system consistency across migrated components
- **Performance optimisation:** Copilot can suggest performance improvements and modern best practices during migration
- **Accessibility enhancement:** AI can help ensure migrated components meet modern accessibility standards

**Business impact:** UI modernisation projects benefit from faster component migration and improved code quality, enabling organisations to deliver modern user experiences more rapidly.

### Pattern 5: Cross-platform code migration

**The challenge:** Converting applications or libraries between programming languages or platforms whilst maintaining feature parity and performance.

**How GitHub Copilot transforms this work:**

- **Language translation:** Copilot can suggest equivalent implementations when converting between programming languages
- **Behaviour consistency:** AI assistance helps ensure the migrated code behaves similarly to the original, reducing the risk of regressions or functional divergence between original and target libraries
- **Pattern preservation:** Copilot can help maintain architectural patterns and design principles during language migration
- **Testing equivalence:** AI can suggest how to recreate test scenarios in the target language or platform

**Business impact:** Cross-platform migrations that previously required extensive research and trial-and-error can be completed with greater confidence and speed.

## The business case for AI-assisted transformation

The introduction of AI-assisted development tools fundamentally changes the economics of large-scale code transformation:

**Reduced time to value:** Projects that previously required months or years can often be completed in significantly shorter timeframes, enabling faster realisation of business benefits.

**Improved quality outcomes:** AI suggestions often include modern best practices and error handling patterns, resulting in higher-quality transformed code.

**Cost efficiency:** The combination of faster delivery and broader team capability reduces the overall cost of transformation initiatives.

**Risk mitigation:** AI-assisted code generation can help identify potential issues and suggest robust solutions, reducing the risk of failed transformations.

These patterns demonstrate that with proper planning, measurement, and tooling support, large-scale code transformations can deliver significant business value whilst managing inherent risks.
