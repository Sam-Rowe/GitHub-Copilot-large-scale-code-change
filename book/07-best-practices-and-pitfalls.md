# Best Practices and Pitfalls

## What works well

New to GitHub Copilot developers need to learn to use all of Copiilot one piece at a time like learning to walk before you can run. 

Working smaller chunks, with more clarity and certainty, then iterating quicker is better than tyring to make huge leaps in one prompt.

## Common mistakes

Over complicating things and trying to constrain everything to be perfect in one prompt. Course correction is better than hitting the target every time.

## Validating and reviewing Copilot-generated code

It is essential that proper code reviews are conducted. This is important. Make sure you have good PR hygene and know how as a team to iterate quickly. The changes will come in faster so you have to review quicker without droppping the quality. This is essential to speeding up the project without becoming the new bottleneck.

Consider Copilot code reivew only as a fast pair of eyes not as the final reviewer.

This is where automated testing is essential.

## Iterative testing and refinement

Wether you use Agile or waterfall with AI to help make large scale code change you need to ensure there are lots of small steps. I have found that small iterative steps to be easier to spot when the tooling is going off course and this requires faster feedback and cycle times to be able to test and apply those changes into production.
