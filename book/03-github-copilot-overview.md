# GitHub Copilot: An Overview

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI powered developer tool by GitHub. It acts as a virtual pair programmer, assisting developers by suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as they type, offering chat and agentic modes of code generation. Copilot is designed to work with a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile companion for software development across different environments.

By leveraging advanced large language models, Copilot can generate contextually relevant code snippets, functions, and even documentation. Its suggestions are based on the current file, project context, and natural language comments, enabling developers to write code more efficiently and explore alternative solutions to programming problems.

Copilot is available as an extension for popular code editors such as Visual Studio Code, XCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs. It integrates seamlessly into the development workflow, providing real-time suggestions that can be accepted, modified, or ignored according to the developerâ€™s needs. While Copilot can significantly boost productivity, it is important for developers to review its output carefully to ensure code quality, correctness, and adherence to project standards.

## Capabilities and limitations
