# Real-World (Style) Workflows

Real world this is changing so fast. What has worked for customers and myself depends on the features I have available to hand. For example building out a list of prompts has worked well for me in the past but with Agent mode it is becoming less relevant to have a list of structured prompts to run one after another than to work on patterns of prompts that can be used in an Agent mode conversation. I suspect in the near future I will have to update this further to account for new ways of working in a fully Agentic way.
